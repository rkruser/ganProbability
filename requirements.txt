Todo:
-----
Standardize generators further (incorporate things like stackgan)
Clean up files (maybe move functions to others, import them)
Standardize model names and folder structure
	- allow for multiple criterions in train
	- 


Train a full pipeline
Visualize
Test lots of models




Generators must have the following attributes / properties:

nz : number of latent features
outshape : a list [] containing the shape of the output, not including the batch dimension
nc : number of colors
imsize : width/height of output image, if this makes sense
numOutDims : Total number of output dims per point (e.g. nc*size*size for images)

All nets must have:
outshape
numOutDims

Every *Embedding* model must also have:
nOutClasses
